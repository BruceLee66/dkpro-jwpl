Changes made in JWPL API v0.7.0
   * Added new assembly exectutions to each module
   * Added default setting to reject sorting templates (language specific - only works for EN and DE so far - should be made configurable)
   * Added code to retrieve pageIds instead of whole page objects
   * Added new tool "WikipediaTemplateInfoGenerator" which gathers information about template usage and creates a SQL dump to be imported in the existing JWPL db.
   * Made ResolvedTemplate class public.
   * Solved title parsing bug with the help of the UKP group. Many thanks.
   * Added workaround to a problem with calculateSrcSpans:
	   * If no specific end token was found, the end of the span was set to the text.length() - which results in an ArrayOutOfBoundsException. It's now set to text.length()-1
	   * Span cannot be smaller than 0 now. This could have happened for empty pages before.
   * Fixed problem with LIKE query in hibernate.
   * Fixed error in getDiscussionArchives.
	   * Hibernate session was commited to late.
   * Implemented a parser patch as suggested by Samy Ateia on the JWPL mailing list http://groups.google.com/group/jwpl/browse_thread/thread/e8438491de61b1c5
   * Created a public method to retrieve an Iterable over all page ids.
   * Created a method to retrieve the page title for a given page id.
   * Updated documentation on the handling of section parts in links. 
   * Adapted existPage() to handle titles with section parts.
   * Now also handles titles with section parts.
   * Added a method isDiscussion() to Page class.
   * Added methods for obtaining article archives.
   * Solved Issue 12: http://code.google.com/p/jwpl/issues/detail?id=12
