Known issues - to be included in the open source version (e.g. as issues in the bug tracker)

I) 
Handling of surrogate characters

There are 4 possible modes of handling UTF8 surrogate characters.
Currently, the only reliable mode is "Discard Revision", in which any revision that contains surrogate characters is discarded.
The other three modes in "de.tudarmstadt.ukp.wikipedia.revisionmachine.difftool.data.SurrogateModes" have been disabled for now.
The corresponding config-section in the config tool has also been made invisible (de.tudarmstadt.ukp.wikipedia.revisionmachine.difftool.config.gui.panels.InputPanel)
The disabled parts are marked with TODO-markers

In order to use the other three surrogate modes, which try to handle surrogate characters differently,
the corresponding code has to be checked. Afterwards, the modes can be reenables in the config tool (InputPanel.java) and the SurrogateModes-class

II)
output/logger/debug-paths in config files

The config tool has been fixed to ensure that those paths have a trailing File.separator.
The system seems to just concatenate the path string with the filename string.
If someone manually creates/alters a config file, this could be still the a bug-source.
It would be best to find all occurences where paths are built (path+filename) and ensure at those points
that a file.separator is put in between.

As long as the config tool is used, this should no longer be a problem.

III)
Page-filter in DiffTool_ST, ArticleConsumer

The only implementation of the interface IArticleNameChecker is currently EnglishArticleNameChecker();
For each wikipedia language version, a separate implementation has to be created 
and has to be chosen by DiffTool_ST/ArticleConsumer according to the current language that is used!!!

It is also unclear why filter-object is both created in DiffTool_ST AND ArticleConsumer!!!
Should only happen in one place.
